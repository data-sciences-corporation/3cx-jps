# Jelastic - 3CX as a Service
![3CX PBX](https://www.3cx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/logo-3.png)
* This is a docker container instance, leveraging a Jelastic curated docker instance.
* There is no officially supplied docker container image for 3cx, but the used container image was shared with me by the 3cx sales team as an option (as Virtuozzo containerization is not supported natively by 3cx).
## Usage:
No special instructions should be needed. 
### Users [Single Use]
* Copy the contents of the .jps file into the text box that is shown when selecting ``import`` -> ``JPS`` \
OR
* Copy the URL of the .jps file into the text box when selecting ``import`` -> ``URL``
### Hosters
* [JCA] Add a "New Installation" in the marketplace and copy the contents of the .jps file into the text box. \
Once published, users will find it in their marketplace catalog.

## Support:
