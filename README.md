# Jelastic - 3CX deployment
* This is a docker container instance, leveraging the jelastic curated docker ce deployment.
* There is no officially supplied docker container image for 3cx, but the used container image was shared with me by the 3cx sales team as an option (as Virtuozzo containerization is not supported natively by 3cx).
## Usage:
No special instructions should be needed. 
### Users [Single Use]
* Copy the contents of the .jps file into the text box that is shown when selecting ``import`` -> ``JPS`` \
OR
* Copy the URL of the .jps file into the text box when selecting ``import`` -> ``URL``
### Hosters
* [JCA] Add a "New Installation" in the marketplace and copy the contents of the .jps file into the text box. \
Once published, users will find it in their marketplace catalog.
